# Student Expense Management System GUI
This program is a GUI based expense management that simplifies tracking and splitting dormitory roommate expenses.

**Note: This program is an assignment of the programming module at Koya University's Software Engineering course (2020). Everything is done according to the assignment requirements. This was my first project building a graphic interface. So, the design, UI/UX, and colors are not perfect.** 

This GUI-based Student Expense Management System is an upgraded version of the <a href="https://github.com/SakarDev/StudentExpenseManagementSystem">console-based </a> program. Just like its predecessor, it helps students track and manage their shared expenses in a more interactive and user-friendly interface. For more details about its functionalities, refer to the project's GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/SakarDev/StudentExpenseManagementSystem">here</a>.

# Run the code:
Ensure that Java is installed on your system. Next, Clone the repository and navigate to src/main/java/welcomeSection.java, and run the program using an IDE such as Eclipse or any other of your choice.

## Bad UI/Ux:
This was my **first project** building a graphic interface. So, the design, UI/UX, and colors are not perfect. I appreciate your understanding.
